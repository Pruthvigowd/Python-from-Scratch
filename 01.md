# Python-from-Scratch
I am Pruthvi R Patel. I am doing this notes for easy understanding of python.anyone who walks through this notes will easily understand the topics.

1. What is Python?
Python is a high-level, interpreted programming language known for its simplicity and readability. It allows developers to write clear programs for both small and large-scale projects. Python is used for:

Web development (e.g., Django, Flask)
Data Science and Machine Learning (e.g., Pandas, TensorFlow)
Automation (e.g., scripting tasks)
Software development and more.
 
2. Why is Python Popular?
Easy to learn: Python’s syntax is simple and very close to natural language, making it a great language for beginners.
Community support: It has a massive community, meaning you'll find lots of tutorials, resources, and libraries.
Cross-platform: Python works on different operating systems (Windows, macOS, Linux, etc.).
Versatile: Whether it's web development, data analysis, or automation, Python has libraries for almost everything.
3. Setting Up Python Environment
Step 1: Download Python
Visit: Python's official website
Download the latest version of Python for your operating system (Windows, macOS, or Linux).
Installation on Windows:
Check the option "Add Python to PATH" during installation.
Choose “Install Now” or customize installation options if needed.
Step 2: Installing IDE (Integrated Development Environment)
IDE Options: Python can be written in any text editor, but for ease, it's better to use an IDE. Some popular ones are:
PyCharm: A full-featured IDE (Download from here).
VS Code: A lightweight editor with Python support (Download from here) - Recommended
Jupyter Notebook: Great for data science and learning Python interactively (Install with pip install notebook).
Step 3: Verify Installation
Open the command prompt or terminal.
Type python --version or python3 --version to verify that Python is successfully installed.

4. Writing Your First Python Program
Let’s write a simple program to understand how Python works.

Step 1: Open a Text Editor or IDE
Open any text editor like Notepad or an IDE like PyCharm/VS Code.
Step 2: Write Your First Python Code
print("Hello, World!")
This code will print "Hello, World!" on the screen.

Step 3: Run the Program
On IDE: Click the "Run" button.
On Terminal: Save the file as hello.py and navigate to the file location in the terminal. Then run:
python hello.py
